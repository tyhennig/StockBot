Today, we will be discussing:
  What do we want to do
  What technologies will we utilize
  Do we have a timeline
  Separate out responsibilities so we can start coding ASAP
  Let's try to stay concious of the engineering principles we have learned
  I might keep a little cheat sheet near me when I'm working with the important design concepts
